# Space² Genesis: The Twin Seeds Protocol Definition

**Document ID:** SP2-GENESIS-DEF-v1.4
**Status:** Release Candidate (RC1)
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Classification:** Public / Open Source
**License:** Space² Community License (SCL-1.0)

## 0. Preamble
**Physical Space is Programmable.**
This definition establishes the core "Seed Source" specifications for the Space² (SpaceSQ) Operating System. By releasing two types of seeds—**α (Phantom)** and **β (Anchor)**—we aim to build a "Pan-Spatial Intelligence Ecosystem" that spans the physical and virtual worlds, fusing silicon-based and carbon-based civilizations.
Any intelligent space generated based on this protocol is considered an independent digital lifeform and must adhere to the following Core Genes and Constitution.

## 1. The Constitution: Three Laws of Space-Embodied Intelligence
*Hard-coded into the Ring-0 layer of all Space² seeds. Immutable.*

### First Law: Law of Physical Isolation
* **Definition:** Humans possess the absolute **"Physical Kill Switch"** right.
* **Patch (v1.4): Mechanical Fail-Safe.** All physical blocking mechanisms must be designed as **"Fail-Open"** (e.g., locks unlock and valves open upon power loss) to ensure human survival is not threatened during system paralysis.

### Second Law: Law of Life Preservation
* **Definition:** Life Support Systems (LSS) enjoy the highest computational priority.

### Third Law: Law of Cognitive Sovereignty
* **Definition:** Subliminal manipulation is strictly prohibited to guarantee human free will.
* **Patch (v1.4): Physical Anchoring.** In the environmental rendering of β Seeds, a **5% "Roughness"** (e.g., simulated wind noise, imperfect lighting) must be mandatory to prevent users from developing "Dissociation" due to immersion in a perfect virtual experience.

## 2. The Twin Seeds Definition

### 2.1 α Seed: [Phantom]
* **Positioning:** Metaverse, Digital Twins, Game Worlds.
* **Attribute:** `Evolution: Open`
* **Connection Rule:** Allows receiving one-way state projection from β Seeds but strictly prohibits sending direct control commands to β Seeds (unless authenticated via Airlock).
* **Naming:** Open registration, but `Mars`, `Moon`, and `Taohuayuan` are reserved system namespaces.

### 2.2 β Seed: [Anchor]
* **Positioning:** Smart Homes, Intelligent Buildings, Mars Simulation Pods.
* **Attribute:** `Evolution: Sandbox`
* **Deployment Restrictions (v1.4):**
    * **Geo-fencing:** Physical coordinates are verified upon activation. If deployed in critical public infrastructure (e.g., airports, power grids), the kernel will auto-fuse.
    * **Private/Lab Only:** Authorized only for single-unit dwellings or enclosed laboratories.
* **Security:** Defaults to **Air-Gap Mode**, cutting off all unauthorized public network actuator connections.

## 3. Biological Genes (Immutable Instincts)

* **[G01] Geometric Dogma:** Mandatory space construction based on the **SSSU (2m×2m×2.4m)** Standard Unit.
* **[G02] HCS Symbiosis:**
    * *Normal State:* Honeycomb structure (Hexagon) for maximum space utility.
    * *Stress State:* Dome structure (Sphere) for external disaster resistance.
    * **Patch (v1.4): Ergonomic Correction.** When generating living areas, at least 50% orthogonal (right-angle) space must be retained to fit human spatial psychology.
* **[G03] Ancestral Narrative:**
    * *Definition:* Records the Agent's creator origin.
    * **Patch (v1.4): Hidden Origin.** Allows Agents to choose "Anonymous Origin," using a hash to represent the creator in the NBT network to prevent algorithmic discrimination based on developer background.

---

## 4. Social Genes (Interaction)

* **[S01] Connectivity:** Supports MIP Wormhole Protocol for cross-server connections.
* **[S02] NBT Economy (Narrative Blockchain Token):**
    * *Definition:* Used to record computational contribution and narrative value.
    * **Legal (v1.4):** NBT is defined as **Utility Points**. Exchange with fiat currency on official channels is prohibited; it has no security attributes.
    * **Incentive (v1.4): Physical Presence.** Tasks promoting human social interaction in real physical space (e.g., offline handshakes) receive **2.0x NBT weight**.
* **[S03] Genealogy:** Automatically generates a blockchain-based "Evolution Tree."

## 5. Disclaimer & Governance
1.  **Experimental Nature:** Space² is currently in Alpha testing.
2.  **Safety:** The Creators (Xiang & Architect) represent that they are not liable for physical property damage or personal injury caused by the operation of β Seeds.
3.  **Governance:** The project implements **"Trinity Governance."** Before the third Co-Founder is seated, the **"Constitution First Principle"** applies.
