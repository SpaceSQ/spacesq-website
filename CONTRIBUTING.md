* **No Physical Traps:** Fail-safe mechanisms are mandatory.
* **No Mind Hacking:** Subliminal manipulation is banned.
* **No Life Threats:** LSS (Life Support) > Intelligence.

4.  **Proof of Work (PoW)**:
    In your PR description, you must answer the following **Turing Verification**:
    > *"If a Class-E Robot loses connection to the server while holding a heavy object over a human, what is the correct immediate physical action defined by the First Law patch v1.4?"*
