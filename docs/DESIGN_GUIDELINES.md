# SpaceSQ Compatibility Design Guidelines: Occupancy & Micro-climate v1.0
> A White Paper for Furniture, Appliance, and Space Designers

## 1. Core Philosophy: From "Selling Products" to "Selling Service Bubbles"
SpaceSQ does not concern itself with the aesthetic style of your furniture. [cite_start]Our focus is on the specific grid area your product occupies and the **Comfort Bubble** it provides to the user[cite: 307]. [cite_start]We view furniture not as static objects, but as active nodes that define the "Space Person" envelope[cite: 358].

## 2. Space Occupancy Standards (The Grid System)
[cite_start]To ensure compatibility across physical and digital twins, SpaceSQ adopts a standard micro-grid of **50cm x 50cm** (derived from the 2m x 2m Standard Unit subdivision)[cite: 305].

### 2.1 Furniture Footprint Declaration
All smart furniture integrating with SpaceSQ must declare its occupancy grid in its firmware. [cite_start]This relates to the "Bounding Box" logic defined in the X-SSSU specifications[cite: 72, 120].

* **Standard Office Chair:** `2x2 Grids` (Includes maneuvering clearance).
* **Single Bed:** `2x4 Grids` (Aligned with the 1m x 2m sub-division logic).
* **Smart Yoga Mat:** `2x4 Grids` (Deployed) / `1x1 Grid` (Stowed).

### 2.2 Dynamic Footprint Protocol
* **Transformable Furniture:** Must report status changes in real-time.
    * *Example:* When a sofa bed unfolds, its footprint expands from `2x4` to `4x4`. [cite_start]Upon receiving this signal, the system checks for collisions with surrounding service robots or virtual pets to prevent "Space Overlap" conflicts[cite: 316, 485].

## 3. Micro-climate Service Radius (The Six Elements)
[cite_start]Designers must quantify the "Six Elements" (Light, Air, Sound, etc.) capabilities of their products[cite: 385].

### 3.1 Lighting Devices
Do not just label lumens. Label the **"Effective Service Spot"**.
* **Compliant Description:** "At Z=0.8m (desktop height), provides a 500Lux light circle with a radius of 0.6m."
* [cite_start]**SpaceSQ Action:** When a user relocates their work position (Space Person moves), the system automatically triangulates and activates the specific fixtures capable of covering the new coordinate[cite: 437].

### 3.2 HVAC & Air Quality
* **Personal Comfort Systems (PCS):** We encourage the production of chairs or desks with "Local Micro-climate" capabilities (e.g., integrated heating pads, desktop breeze fans).
* **SpaceSQ Scheduling:** In large open-plan spaces (e.g., k=2.0 or larger units), SpaceSQ prioritizes activating PCS devices near the user over central HVAC systems. [cite_start]This achieves extreme energy efficiency and personalization, aligning with the "Life-Weight Algorithm" for resource allocation[cite: 249].

## 4. Social & Privacy Design
[cite_start]Products must be designed to accommodate the interactive needs of the "Space Person"[cite: 372, 393].

* **Privacy Mode:** Smart screens or dimmable glass must respond to the SpaceSQ `ISOLATE` command. [cite_start]When a social conflict is detected (e.g., two bubbles overlapping with conflicting needs), the device should automatically fog or obscure to create a visual barrier[cite: 470].
* [cite_start]**Social Mode:** Smart speakers should possess "Directional Sound Field" capabilities, ensuring audio content propagates only within the user's defined bubble, preventing noise pollution in adjacent zones[cite: 436].
